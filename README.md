# Landfall
A Minecraft PvP map for the gamemode **Race for Wool**, created by **Ausxh** and **CatProductions**.

As an innovative Race for Wool map, Landfall is the first RFW map to include intentionally incremental resource acquisition. This slows down the pace of the early game compared to other maps and allows players to choose with vastly more precision than usual exactly how much time they wish to spend gathering resources to become stronger. The strength of the strongest gear is also not much stronger than the strength of what can be reliably obtained even after death, which reduces the long-term punishment of death (which has been a problem with the gamemode).

In my humble opinion, this is the best map ever made for Race for Wool.
